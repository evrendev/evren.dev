Later, my interest in programming led me to pursue a degree in software engineering, shifting my focus to the web-based software field, where I’ve now been working for the past 9 years. On the backend, I primarily work with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core alongside MS SQL, while my frontend toolkit includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and Vue.js. I’m committed to writing clean, maintainable code and strictly adhere to design principles to ensure my work is both efficient and visually appealing. My passion lies in building responsive, user-friendly web applications that meet modern standards for functionality and performance. Whether it’s creating a straightforward website or a complex application, I strive to bring innovative ideas to life with precision and attention to detail.",

The frontend is built with Vue.js, SASS, TypeScript, Pinia, Docker, and Jest to deliver a responsive and interactive user experience. This platform allows seamless management of all sports departments and teams, covering athletes, matches, and related standings or tournament results. Additionally, it includes accessible ticket organization for disabled fans, as well as the design of all interactive surveys and forms, providing a comprehensive digital solution for the club’s needs."
